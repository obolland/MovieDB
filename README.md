Movie DB created in NextJS and deployed to Vercel https://movie-db-jade.vercel.app/

<p>This is a 'universal app' which I've built this to showcase the latest features of the ever-evolving Next JS framework.<br>
This app demonstrates the 'universal' features of Next JS, including automatic code splitting and the utilisation of both Serverless side rendering (the API routes in this application where built using serverless functions), and statically generated HTML.</p>

<p>This app allows the user to perform all CRUD operations against Google Firestore.<br>
Add a movie with the "Add Movie to DB" button, and delete or edit an existing movie after navigating to page of that specific movie.<p>
